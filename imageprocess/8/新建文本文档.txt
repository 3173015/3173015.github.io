Entoloma hochstetteri

Entoloma hochstetteri is a species of mushroom found in New Zealand and India. The small mushroom is a distinctive all-blue colour, while the gills have a slight reddish tint from the spores. The blue coloring of the fruit body is due to three azulene pigments.[1] Whether Entoloma hochstetteri is poisonous or not is unknown.

The Māori name for the blue mushroom is werewere-kokako because the colour is similar to the blue wattle of the kōkako bird.[2]

This species was one of six native fungi featured in a set of fungal stamps issued in New Zealand in 2002.

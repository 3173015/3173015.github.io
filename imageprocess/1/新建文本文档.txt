Gomphales

The Gomphales are an order of basidiomycete fungi.[2][3][4] Some or all families belonging to Gomphales have been sometimes included in the order Phallales (and vice versa - [5] they are also sometimes treated as synonyms),[6] the now-obsolete Ramariaceae was also previously included in Cantharellales. Recent phylogenetic analyses include in Gomphales the families of the original description of the order by Walter JÃ¼lich, with addition of Clavariadelphaceae.[7] According to one 2008 estimate, the Gomphales contain 18 genera and 336 species.[8]
